A few days ago, I learned React and made a small project to understand its functionality. I created a tiny e-commerce website where you can sort products by category and add your own product, but it will disappear if you reload because I'm using a fake product API. I learned React Router, React Toast, Context API, useEffect, useState, and many other things. It was fun making this project!
